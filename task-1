Differences between Document and Window Objectss :

Window Objects:

  * Web browser is made up of hierarchy of objects, at the root level we have a Window Objects and it is the root 
    level element in any web page.
  
  * The Window Objects is a global object in client - side JavaScript, representing the browser window containing 
    a DOM document and acts as the root of the DOM.

  * The Window Objects is supported by all browsers, represents the browser's window and automatically includes 
    global javaScript objects, functions and variables as members.

  * The Window Objects is responsible for managing global variables, functions and objects, providing methods for 
    browser interaction and managing properties related to frames, tabs or windows.

 Properties : 
  
  1. window.innerHeight - the inner height of the browser window.

  2. window.innerWidth - the inner width of the browser window.

  3. Properties like document, location are properties of the Window object.

 Methods :

  1. window.open() - open a new window.

  2. window.close() - close the current window.

  3. window.moveTo() - move the current window.

  4. window.resizeTo() - resize the current window.

  5. alert() - displays a dialog box with a specified message and an OK button.

  6. confirm() - displays a dialog box with a specified message, along with OK and Cancel buttons. 



Document Objects :

  * It is the direct child of the window object. It is a Document Object Model (DOM).

  * The Document object is the HTML document that appears in the browser window and serves as an interface for 
    interacting with the web pageâ€™s content. The browser generates a DOM of a web page upon loading it. You can 
    access it via window.document or document.

  * The DOM is a logical tree in a document, with methods allowing programmatic access to change its structure, 
    style, or content.

  * The DOM manipulation tool offers methods to access and manipulate the structure and content of a document. 
    It represents the entire HTML document as a node tree, with the Document object as the root node. It allows 
    dynamic updates and interactions with web page content.

 Properties :

  1. element.innerHTML = Change the inner HTML of an element

  2. element.attribute = Change the attribute value of an HTML element

 Methods : 

  1. document.createElement() - Create an HTML element

  2. document.removeChild() - Remove an HTML element

  3. document.getElementById() - retrieves an element from the document with the specified 'id'

  4. document.getElementsByTagName() - returns a live HTMLCollection of elements with the given tag name

  5. document.querySelector() - returns the first Element within the document that matches the specified CSS 
    selector, or group of selectors


Conclusion : 

  Window manages browser interactions, while document acts as an interface for content manipulation.
